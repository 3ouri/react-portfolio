              I had the pleasure of working with Abdallah when he was at
              ESKADENIA Software working as a technical team lead managing Java
              software engineers. As the director of product marketing, I worked
              with Abdallah on several products, and we collaborated in a number
              of projects as well.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Abdallah is a very bright and analytical individual. He is
              methodical, and he learns new things quickly. More than that,
              Abdallah can always be counted on to do what is asked of him. His
              job will always be completed on schedule, and he is an excellent
              team player with strong collaboration abilities and peopleâ€™s
              skills. Abdallah takes responsibility for his actions, making him
              the sort of guy you want by your side when things don't go as
              planned because he will work with you to find answers and find new
              methods to deliver on promises.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have no qualms giving Abdallah the strongest recommendations for
              positions that utilize his strong technical, interpersonal, and
              leadership skills.
